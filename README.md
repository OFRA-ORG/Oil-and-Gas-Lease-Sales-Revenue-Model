Offshore and Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Models
Overview
This repository contains models for analyzing federal revenue impacts of federal oil and gas leasing on offshore and onshore lands. 
Models
•	Offshore Leasing Model:
o	Based on the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) five-year plans.
o	Simulates revenues under varying lease sale scenarios.
o	Tracks revenues based on production delays (7–10 years) over 10-, 15-, and 20-year horizons.
•	Onshore Leasing Model:
o	Based on assumed acreage leased under varying lease sales scenarios.
o	Tracks revenues based on production delays (3–5 years) and over 10-, 15-, and 20-year horizons.
